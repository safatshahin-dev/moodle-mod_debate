# Debate #

Debate is a moodle activity which allows students to debate in a given topic inside moodle.


## Features ##

Adding a debate activity is simple, just the usual way, go to the course, turn editing on
and add the activity.
A debate activity will have three parts of it:
1. A name of the activity (a usual moodle activity name)
2. The topic of the debate (the actual topic where the users will debate on)
3. Activity description, a usual moodle field where you can upload pictures or other descriptions which can be viewed
on either of the course page, or the debate page or both. There is a checkbox while adding or deleting a debate
instance allows to setup this feature.   

Debate activity also allows you to control the response from the users. There are the following
options available when it comes to accepting response from the users:
1. Unlimited response - users can add as many as positive and negative response as they 
want.
2. Allow one response in one side - only one response is allowed in any one side,
either positive or negative.
3. Allow one response in each side - allow any one response either in positive or 
negative side.
   
Debate allows the control of activity completion of the module, these are the types of completion you can use:
1. User viewing the debate activity (and/or) 
2. User submitting the required number of debate responses (for example, user will have to submit 2 responses to complete this module)

Debate logs all types of activities inside the debate instance, the following events are logged in moodle log:
1. Visiting a debate instance
2. Adding a debate instance
3. Updating a debate instance
4. Deleting a debate instance
