## What does this plugin do ##

The debate is a moodle activity that allows students to debate on a given topic inside moodle.<br />
It is a usual activity in any face to face class that moderators or teacher or even employees are divided into group and<br />
they are asked to give their opinion or debate on a given topic. This plugin is the approach to take that whole scenario inside moodle.<br />

## Features ##

### Use debate activity in a course ###
Adding a debate activity is simple, just the usual way, go to the course, turn editing on
and add the activity. A debate activity will have three parts:<br />
1. A name of the activity (a usual moodle activity name).<br />
2. The topic of the debate (the actual topic where the users will debate on).<br />
3. Activity description, a usual moodle field where you can upload pictures or other descriptions which can be viewed<br />
   on either of the course page or the debate page or both. There is a checkbox while adding or deleting a debate<br />
   instance allows to set up this feature.   <br />

### Create teams in debate activity ###
You can create multiple teams for a debate activity for positive and negative side for a group of users.
You will need to use the groups feature inside the course, create groups and use those groups as a part of each team.
Each team can have:<br/>
1. A name of the team.<br/>
2. Number of responses allowed for the team.<br/>
3. The side of the team, either positive or negative.<br/>
4. The selection of groups for each team will determine which user goes to which team.<br/>


### Debate activity allows you to control the response from the users ###
These are the following options available when it comes to accepting response from the users:<br />
1. Unlimited response - users can add as many positive and negative response as they want.<br />
2. Allow one response on one side - only one response is allowed on any one side, either positive or negative.<br />
3. Allow one response on each side - allow anyone to respond either on the positive or negative side.<br />
4. Use debate teams - use teams feature instead which will control these for individual teams.<br />

### Debate allows the control of activity completion of the module ###
These are the types of completion you can use:<br />
