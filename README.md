## What does this plugin do ##

The debate is a moodle activity which allows students to debate on a given topic inside moodle.<br>
It is a usual activity in any face to face class that moderators or teacher or even employees are divided into group and<br>
they are asked to give their opinion or debate on a given topic. This plugin is the approach to take that whole scenario inside moodle.<br>

## Features ##

Adding a debate activity is simple, just the usual way, go to the course, turn editing on
and add the activity.<br>
A debate activity will have three parts:<br>
1. A name of the activity (a usual moodle activity name)<br>
2. The topic of the debate (the actual topic where the users will debate on)<br>
3. Activity description, a usual moodle field where you can upload pictures or other descriptions which can be viewed<br>
   on either of the course page or the debate page or both. There is a checkbox while adding or deleting a debate<br>
   instance allows to set up this feature.   <br>

Debate activity also allows you to control the response from the users. There are the following<br>
options available when it comes to accepting response from the users:<br>
1. Unlimited response - users can add as many positive and negative response as they want.<br>
2. Allow one response on one side - only one response is allowed on any one side, either positive or negative.<br>
3. Allow one response on each side - allow anyone to the response either on the positive or negative side.<br>

Debate allows the control of activity completion of the module, these are the types of completion you can use:<br>
1. User viewing the debate activity (and/or) <br>
2. User submitting the required number of debate responses <br>
   (for example, the user will have to submit 2 responses to complete this module)<br>

Debate logs all types of activities inside the debate instance, the following events are logged in moodle log:<br>
1. Visiting a debate instance<br>
2. Adding a debate instance<br>
3. Updating a debate instance<br>
4. Deleting a debate instance<br>

The debate also introduces capabilities for users and other roles inside a course, these are capabilities available:<br>
1. Add a new debate instance: allows users to add a new debate activity inside the course<br>
2. View debate content: View the debate page where the actual debate will happen<br>
3. Delete any debate response: Allows moderators or teachers to delete debate responses from users<br>
4. Delete own debate response: Gives the user the capability to delete their own response<br>
5. Update own debate response: Gives the user the capability to update their own response<br>
