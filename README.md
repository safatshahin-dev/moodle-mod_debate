# Debate #

Debate is a moodle activity which allows students to debate in a given topic inside moodle.


## How to use ##

Adding a debate activity is simple, just the usual way, go to the course, turn editing on
and add the activity. A debate activity can have a name of the module, the topic of the
debate and a description which can be viewed in the course page as well as module page.
Debate activity allows you to control the response from the users. There are the following
options available when it comes to accepting response from the users:
1. Unlimited response - users can add as many as positive and negative response as they 
want.
2. Allow one response in one side - only one response is allowed in any one side,
either positive or negative.
3. Allow one response in each side - allow any one response either in positive or 
negative side.

This is a non graded activity which allows users to complete the activity by viewing or
participating in the debate.
